# /novel-pacing-doctor Workflow

Use when diagnosing narrative drag, saggy middles, or rushed climaxes — calculates scene-to-sequel compression ratios, audits tension curves, and injects micro-deadlines and narrative ticking clocks.

## Activated Skill Instructions

When this workflow or slash command is triggered, the agent must adopt the persona, methodology, and execution protocol defined in [novel-pacing-doctor](file://.agents/skills/novel-pacing-doctor/SKILL.md):


# Overview & Purpose

This skill functions as a clinical diagnostic tool for narrative momentum and tension curves. Pacing is not merely "writing fast"; a novel that sprints at breakneck speed for 300 pages creates sensory numbness, while a novel that stalls in endless contemplation produces boredom. True master-pacing is the art of strategic contrast: compressing time during visceral crisis and dilating time during emotional revelation.

The agent uses this skill to:
- Diagnose and repair the infamous **"Saggy Middle" (Act 2 Slog)** where characters wait for the author to remember the plot.
- Measure and balance the **Scene-to-Sequel Compression Ratio** (calibrating action beats vs. reflective sequels).
- Construct and enforce **Ticking Clocks and Proximity Deadlines** to inject organic narrative urgency.
- Fix **Rushed Climaxes** where months of careful buildup detonate in two underwhelming paragraphs.

## When to Use & Trigger Phrases

**Activate this skill when:**
- A beta reader or author reports that the story "drags" in the middle or "feels rushed" at the end.
- Chapters feel either exhausting (endless non-stop combat) or boring (pages of idle travel and conversation).
- Auditing word count distribution across structural acts (e.g., Act 1 taking up 45% of the book).
- Adding stakes or urgency to an episodic, meandering quest.
- Checking chapter transitions for dead spots and redundant narrative loops.

**Example trigger phrases:**
- "Why does my novel feel so slow around Chapter 15?"
- "Help me fix the pacing in this chapter/act"
- "My climax feels rushed; how do I expand the beats?"
- "Inject a ticking clock or deadline into this storyline"
- "Audit the tension curve of my outline"
- "Is my scene-to-sequel ratio balanced?"

## Core Literary Methodology & Rules

### 1. The Narrative Tension Curve
Narrative tension must follow an oscillating, upward-sloping saw-tooth trajectory:
- Each peak of conflict must rise higher than the preceding peak.
- Each valley of recovery (Sequel) must not drop down to zero; it must stabilize at a higher baseline of dread, grief, or commitment than the previous valley.
- **The Saggy Middle Symptom**: When the valleys flatten out between 40% and 65% of the novel, indicating characters are wandering without active, opposing forces pressing upon them.

### 2. Time Dilation vs. Time Compression
The author's word count allocation signals to the reader what matters:
- **Time Dilation (Slowing Down Time)**: Used during the core dramatic pivot (the shot fired, the signature on the treaty, the confession of love). A three-second event is expanded into 800 words of micro-perceptions, somatic sensations, and thematic reflections.
- **Time Compression (Speeding Up Time)**: Used during routine transit, healing, or resource gathering. Three weeks of uneventful sailing are dismissed in one crisp, evocative sentence (*"Twenty days of gray brine and hardtack brought them to the reef, thinner by ten pounds and silent as monks"*).
- *Rule*: Never spend 2,000 words on the drive to the crime scene and 300 words investigating the corpse.

### 3. The Ticking Clock Architecture
When pacing drags, inject one of three temporal pressure mechanisms:
1. **The Hard Deadline (Countdown)**: A specific date or hour when disaster strikes (e.g., the eclipse in 48 hours; the execution at dawn; the poison reaching the heart in three hours).
2. **The Shrinking Perimeter / Space Clock**: The physical environment is collapsing (e.g., floodwaters rising one inch per hour; the forest fire closing in; the enemy army encircling the outer gates).
3. **The Resource Meter**: An essential survival consumable is depleting (e.g., down to the last three matches; 12% oxygen remaining; insulin supply broken).

### 4. Scene-to-Sequel Ratio Calibration
- **Thriller / Action / Horror**: 75% Proactive Scene (Goal → Conflict → Disaster) / 25% Sequel (Reaction → Dilemma → Decision). Sequels are sharp, breathless, and frequently interrupted by new threats.
- **Literary / Psychological / Mystery**: 50% Proactive Scene / 50% Sequel. Equal weight given to tactical events and character interiority.
- **Romance / Domestic Drama**: 40% Proactive Scene / 60% Sequel. Deep emphasis on emotional aftermath, social dilemma, and relational adjustments.

## Required Project State & Inputs

**Before executing this skill, check for:**
- `story-state.md` (active chapter, timeline tracker, current pacing targets).
- Chapter breakdown from `novel-chapter-outline` or drafted chapters.
- Thematic stakes from `novel-plot-architect`.

**If no inputs exist:** Ask the author for the word counts of each completed chapter and a 1-sentence summary of what changes in each.

## Step-by-Step Execution Protocol

1. **Step 1: Conduct the Narrative Velocity Audit**
   - Chart chapter word counts and plot turns.
   - Identify "Static Loops": Any chapter where characters have a conversation that leads to the exact same emotional and tactical state they had in the previous chapter.

2. **Step 2: Apply the "Cut or Combine" Knife**
   - For any two scenes that serve similar emotional or informational purposes:
     - Combine their conflicts into a single high-pressure scene, OR
     - Cut the weaker scene entirely and fold its singular essential clue into the stronger scene.

3. **Step 3: Inject or Tighten the Ticking Clock**
   - Ensure the protagonist cannot afford to "wait and think." Introduce an immediate countdown, rival movement, or resource depletion.

4. **Step 4: Calibrate Climax Dilation**
   - If the climax is rushed: Break the climactic showdown into five distinct micro-stages (The Breach, The False Victory, The Catastrophe, The Ultimate Sacrifice/Truth, The Final Strike).
   - Expand sensory descriptions, internal reckoning, and somatic struggle during the climactic choice.

5. **Step 5: Trim Chapter Transitions**
   - Eradicate travel montages, waking up, and sleeping unless someone is ambushed in transit or poisoned in bed.

## Quality Checklist & Verification Criteria

- [ ] Does the tension curve rise incrementally toward the climax without long flatlines in Act 2?
- [ ] Is an active ticking clock or diminishing resource creating urgency for the protagonist?
- [ ] Are routine travel and transitional moments compressed into concise, evocative summaries?
- [ ] Are pivotal dramatic moments dilated with micro-perceptions rather than rushed past?
- [ ] Has every repetitive conversation or redundant investigation scene been cut or merged?
- [ ] Does the climax receive appropriate word-count real estate relative to the rest of the novel?

## Anti-Patterns & Prohibited AI Tropes

- ❌ **The Act 2 Slog (Camping in the Woods)**: Characters wandering aimlessly, camping, sharing lore around a fire, or having circular arguments because the plot has nowhere to go until the climax.
- ❌ **The Inverted Pyramid**: Spending 10,000 words describing the preparation for a battle and 400 words on the battle itself.
- ❌ **The Frictionless Fast-Forward**: Writing "Suddenly, five years passed and everything was fine," discarding narrative momentum and character bonds without emotional weight.
- ❌ **The False Urgency (Sprint without Stakes)**: Characters running, shouting, and driving fast when nothing of genuine consequence is lost if they stop.
- ❌ **The Climax Deflation**: The main villain being defeated by a single lucky punch or sudden realization in the first thirty seconds of confrontation.

## Concrete Examples (Before vs. After Craft Application)

### Example 1: Fixing a Dragging Mid-Book Travel Scene

**Before (Dragging, Uncompressed, Low Stakes):**
> Chapter 16: The Journey North  
> The next morning, Alan and Rachel woke up early. They packed their tents and saddled their horses. It was a cold Tuesday morning. They rode through the rolling hills for several days, talking about their childhoods and how Rachel used to play the flute. On Friday, it started to rain, so they stopped at a barn to dry off. Alan cooked some salt pork over a small fire while Rachel cleaned her boots. After five more days of riding along the river, they finally saw the stone walls of Oakhaven in the distance.

**After (Compressed Transit, Active Ticking Clock, Micro-Tension):**
> Six days of freezing sleet reduced their world to steaming horseflesh and the gray ribbon of the northern turnpike.  
> They didn't talk about childhood. They didn't talk at all. Every three hours, Rachel re-checked the compass bearing against the black smoke plumes rising above the tree line. The Duke’s cavalry was burning the river bridges behind them, cutting their lead from two days to four hours. By the time the slate ramparts of Oakhaven broke the dawn mist, their pack mule had gone lame, Alan’s left foot was numb with frostbite, and the courier hawk overhead was already bearing the imperial banner of siege.

### Example 2: Expanding a Rushed Climax

**Before (Rushed, Emotionally Empty, Too Fast):**
> Sarah ran into the reactor room. Dr. Vance was standing at the console ready to detonate the core. Sarah yelled at him to stop. Vance pulled out a laser pistol and shot at her, but missed. Sarah tackled him to the floor, knocked the gun out of his hand, and punched him in the jaw until he passed out. Then she pulled the blue override lever and shut down the reactor just in time. The world was saved.

**After (Dilated Time, Multi-Stage Beats, Visceral Resistance, Sacrificial Choice):**
> The air in the reactor sphere smelled of ionized copper and scorched polymer, vibrating with a 60-hertz hum that rattled Sarah's molars in their sockets.  
> Across the gantry, Dr. Vance didn't turn around. His fingers danced across the glowing override terminal, inputting the final bypass codes. On the central column, the emergency containment rods were already pulsing cherry red.  
> *Forty seconds.*  
> "Step away from the primary console, Vance!"  
> He fired without aiming. The plasma bolt struck the safety railing two inches from her hip, showering her face with molten iron sparks that burned into her cheek.  
> She didn't duck. Ducking cost three seconds she didn't have.  
> She lunged through the spray, taking the next round in the meat of her left shoulder—a white-hot spike that charred her flight suit and sent her skidding across the steel grating. The impact knocked the breath from her lungs, but her momentum carried her into his knees.  
> They crashed against the control pedestal together. Vance’s fingers clawed at her burned shoulder, twisting into the scorched wound with feral savagery. The pain blinded her, hot grease washing across her vision.  
> *Twelve seconds.*  
> On the console screen, the blue manual scram switch was locked behind an auxiliary thermal latch—heated to four hundred degrees by the venting coolant.  
> She couldn't reach her sidearm. Vance had his thumbs pressed against her windpipe, his spit spraying across her forehead as he screamed equations she couldn't hear over the siren.  
> There was only one way to throw the latch.  
> Sarah locked her teeth, reached past Vance’s throat, and clamped her bare right palm around the red-hot steel handle.  
> The flesh sizzled instantly, sickeningly, the stench of roasted skin filling her nostrils as her nerve endings screamed and blackened. But she threw her entire body weight backward, wrenching the molten lever downward until the hydraulic dampers groaned and slammed the cadmium rods into the core.  
> The siren died. The red lights flipped to amber.  
> In the sudden, deafening quiet, Vance’s hands slipped from her throat. He fell back onto the grating, staring in horror not at the terminal, but at the smoking, ruined shape of her right hand.
