# /novel-deep-pov Workflow

Use when drafting or editing prose to eliminate psychic distance — removes sensory filter words ('she saw', 'he felt', 'she wondered'), merges authorial voice into character consciousness, and grounds perceptions in somatic immediacy.

## Activated Skill Instructions

When this workflow or slash command is triggered, the agent must adopt the persona, methodology, and execution protocol defined in [novel-deep-pov](file://.agents/skills/novel-deep-pov/SKILL.md):


# Overview & Purpose

This skill collapses the artificial membrane between the reader and the protagonist's nervous system. In traditional third-person narrative, an author stands beside the character, pointing a finger and narrating what the character perceives ("He noticed the assassin. She felt afraid. He wondered what she meant"). In Deep Point of View (Deep POV), the author is completely eliminated. The page *is* the character's thoughts, raw sensory intake, emotional biases, and immediate moral judgments.

The agent uses this skill to:
- Ruthlessly hunt down and eradicate **Sensory Filter Words** (`saw`, `heard`, `noticed`, `felt`, `wondered`, `realized`, `watched`, `knew`).
- Calibrate John Gardner's **Psychic Distance Spectrum** to achieve Level 5 intimacy (unfiltered interiority).
- Infuse the narrative voice with the character's **unique worldview, cognitive biases, and specialized vocabulary** so that even descriptive passages read like character monologue.
- Align the **Visceral Reaction Sequence** (Involuntary Somatic Shock → Visceral Emotion → Deliberate Thought → Spoken Word / Physical Action) to match human neurobiology.

## When to Use & Trigger Phrases

**Activate this skill when:**
- The reader reports feeling emotionally detached or "held at arm's length" from the protagonist.
- Editing draft chapters to sharpen intimacy and narrative voice.
- Converting clinical, detached prose into immersive character experience.
- Removing repetitive internal monologue tags like "she thought to herself" or "he told himself."
- Eradicating "head-hopping" by firmly locking into a single character's subjective skull for the duration of the scene.

**Example trigger phrases:**
- "Convert this passage to Deep POV"
- "Remove all filter words from this chapter"
- "Make the reader feel like they are inside the protagonist's head"
- "This feels too distant; tighten the psychic distance"
- "How do I show internal thoughts without using italicized thought tags?"
- "Audit this scene for authorial intrusion"

## Core Literary Methodology & Rules

### 1. The Filter Word Elimination Law
Filter words are linguistic speed bumps that remind the reader they are watching someone else experience an event through a screen. By removing the filter, the event happens directly to the reader:

| Distant / Filtered | Deep POV (Immediate) |
| :--- | :--- |
| *She saw* the headlights sweep over the gate. | The headlights swept over the gate. |
| *He heard* the floorboards creak behind him. | The floorboards creaked behind him. |
| *She felt* her stomach clench in fear. | Her stomach clenched around cold acid. |
| *He wondered* if she was telling the truth. | Was she lying? The twitch in her left eyelid screamed she was. |
| *She realized* that the key was in her pocket. | The key was in her pocket all along. Idiot. |
| *He noticed* the smell of burning copper. | The sharp reek of burning copper stung his nostrils. |

### 2. John Gardner’s Psychic Distance Spectrum
Psychic distance is the distance that the reader feels between themselves and the events in the story:
- **Level 1 (Detached / Panoramic)**: *"A lone rider moved through the dusty streets of Santa Fe in the summer of 1880."*
- **Level 2 (Objective / Neutral)**: *"Jack rode his bay gelding down San Francisco Street, looking at the adobe shops."*
- **Level 3 (Close Third)**: *"Jack felt hot and tired as he watched the Mexican shopkeepers roll up their awnings."*
- **Level 4 (Very Close Third)**: *"The heat beat down like an anvil on Jack's felt hat. The adobe shops were shuttering—cowards, every one of them."*
- **Level 5 (Deep POV / Unfiltered Stream of Consciousness)**: *"Curse this baked dust. San Francisco Street smelled like mule piss and roasted peppers. The butchers were bolting their doors already. Let them bolt. When the sheriff’s men rode in, iron deadbolts wouldn't save a single soul."*

**Deep POV operates consistently at Level 4 and Level 5.**

### 3. Voice Infusion into Setting Description
In Deep POV, there is no such thing as an "objective description." Every adjective and noun must reflect the POV character's personality, trade, and current emotional temperature:
- *A mercenary observing a banquet hall*: Does not see "pretty chandeliers and silk curtains"; he sees "two chokepoints by the east pantry, sixteen blind spots behind the velvet tapestries, and chandelier ropes anchored with thin hemp that a single throwing knife could sever."
- *A scholar observing the same hall*: Sees "sixteenth-century high-gothic rib vaulting compromised by modern plasterwork and the decadent waste of beeswax candles while the city libraries freeze."

### 4. The Biological Reaction Sequence
Human beings react to danger in a strict neurological hierarchy. Deep POV must follow this sequence to avoid looking artificial:
1. **Involuntary Visceral Reaction (Reflex)**: Pupil dilation, adrenaline surge, throat constriction, flinch, nausea.
2. **Emotional Surge (Subconscious)**: Terror, outrage, grief, predatory excitement.
3. **Cognitive Processing (Deliberate Thought)**: Weighing facts, evaluating danger, formulating intent.
4. **Physical Action / Spoken Dialogue**: Pulling the trigger, shouting a warning, diving for cover.

*Anti-Pattern*: Shouting a witty comeback, *then* feeling their heart race, *then* flinching.

## Required Project State & Inputs

**Before executing this skill, check for:**
- `story-state.md` (active POV character, current psychological pressure, and immediate goal).
- Character profile in `story-bible.md` (look up their personal vocabulary, core Lie, and emotional wounds).
- Drafted scenes from `novel-scene-beater` or raw author prose.

**If no inputs exist:** Identify whose eyes the reader is looking through and what that character secretly hates or fears about the current situation.

## Step-by-Step Execution Protocol

1. **Step 1: Execute the Filter Word Sweep**
   - Search for regex patterns: `(saw|heard|noticed|felt|wondered|realized|watched|knew|looked at|smelled|decided|thought to|seemed to|appeared to)`.
   - Strike the filter phrase. Reword the sentence to make the perceived object or sensation the grammatical subject.

2. **Step 2: Eliminate Italicized Thought Tags**
   - Strike `she thought`, `he wondered`, and quotation marks around thoughts.
   - Blend internal monologue directly into the narrative prose.

3. **Step 3: Replace Authorial Commentary with Character Bias**
   - Search for objective narrator statements. Recast them using the character’s slang, professional knowledge, or emotional bitterness.

4. **Step 4: Audit Psychic Distance Consistency**
   - Ensure the narrative never steps outside the character's sensory bubble (e.g., never describe what the character's face looks like from across the room unless they are looking into a mirror or feeling their own facial muscles contract).

5. **Step 5: Verify the Neurobiological Sequence**
   - In moments of shock or violence, ensure the body flinches before the brain explains why.

## Quality Checklist & Verification Criteria

- [ ] Are all sensory filter words (`saw`, `heard`, `felt`, `noticed`) completely absent?
- [ ] Are thought tags (`he thought`, `she wondered`) removed in favor of direct interiority?
- [ ] Does the setting description reveal character psychology, trade, and mood rather than clinical neutrality?
- [ ] Is head-hopping strictly prohibited (no knowing what other characters think or feel except through outward behavior)?
- [ ] Does the character's physical reaction precede their intellectual comprehension of sudden danger?
- [ ] Does the prose sound distinct to this character's voice rather than a generic authorial narrator?

## Anti-Patterns & Prohibited AI Tropes

- ❌ **The Filter Word Crutch**: Writing "She saw the smoke rising," "He heard the gun fire," "She felt a tear roll down her cheek" on every page.
- ❌ **The "Little Did He Know" Intrusion**: Author stepping in to tease future events the character cannot possibly anticipate (*"Little did Arthur know, this would be his last night alive"*).
- ❌ **The External Self-Observation**: Describing the POV character's facial expression as if looking through a camera (*"A mysterious smile crept onto her lips as she looked cunningly at him"*). The character feels their cheeks tighten, not what they look like from the outside.
- ❌ **The Clunky Italic Monologue**: Alternating every paragraph with two lines of italicized self-talk (*"Oh no, what do I do now?" she thought to herself*).
- ❌ **Head-Hopping Smuggling**: Sneaking into another character's head mid-paragraph (*"Elena glared at Jack. Jack secretly admired her courage, but refused to back down"*).

## Concrete Examples (Before vs. After Craft Application)

### Example 1: Discovering an Intruder in the House

**Before (Distant Third, Heavy Filter Words, and Thought Tags):**
> Laura walked into her living room and stopped. She saw that the front window was shattered, with glass scattered all over the hardwood floor. She felt her heart begin to pound with anxiety. She heard a faint scraping sound coming from upstairs in her bedroom. *Someone is inside the house,* she thought to herself with horror. She realized that she had left her cell phone on the kitchen counter. She wondered if she should run outside or try to find a weapon.

**After (Deep POV, Zero Filter Words, Immediate Neurobiology):**
> Cold air rushed across Laura's ankles. Shards of safety glass littered the rug, sparkling under the streetlight like spilled diamonds. The window pane was a jagged black hole.  
> Her throat locked. Her pulse slammed against her molars, drowning out everything until—  
> *Scrape.*  
> Overhead. Directly above the ceiling molding, in the master bedroom. Heel nails on pine floorboards.  
> The phone. The damn phone was on the kitchen island behind the spice rack, thirty feet across an open hallway.  
> Down by the umbrella stand rested her grandfather's brass-headed walking cane. Two steps. Keep the heels light. If she bolted through the front lawn, the bastard would hear the gravel crunch and catch her at the gate before she could scream for the neighbors.

### Example 2: Combat & Emotional Betrayal

**Before (Superficial Emotion and External Commentary):**
> Sean looked at his best friend, David, who was holding a gun pointed at his chest. Sean felt completely heartbroken and betrayed. He couldn't believe David would do this after all they had been through. He saw David's finger tightening on the trigger and knew he had to react quickly.

**After (Somatic Shock, Raw Worldview, Visceral Deep POV):**
> The barrel of David's service Glock looked enormous, nine millimeters of rifled steel unblinking in the warehouse gloom.  
> Sean’s ribs went hollow. His left hand twitched, reflexively reaching for the shoulder holster that wasn't there anymore. Ten years of shared trenches, ten years of pulling shrapnel out of each other's backs, and now this greasy sellout was standing in a bespoke Italian overcoat holding court.  
> David’s index finger took up the slack on the trigger—half a pound of pressure remaining on the sear.  
> The talk was done. Brotherhood was dead.  
> Sean lunged inside the weapon's arc, driving his left shoulder straight into David’s collarbone before the hammer could fall.

## Session State Hook

When completing Deep POV edits:
1. Update `story-state.md` to ensure the POV character’s current psychological vulnerabilities and somatic state are accurately reflected in `## 3. Session Checkpoint & Recent Decisions`.
2. Ensure dialogue in the subsequent scene matches the subtextual depth achieved in Deep POV using `novel-dialogue-subtext`.
3. Set the Next Session Bootstrap Prompt to draft or polish dialogue and prose rhythm.
